## Dashboard Components

### 1. EC2 Instances
- **CPU Utilization**: Display the CPU utilization percentage for all EC2 instances.
- **Network In/Out**: Monitor the incoming and outgoing network traffic for each instance.
- **Disk Read/Write Operations**: Track disk activity on the instances.

### 2. Lambda Functions
- **Error Count**: Show the number of errors generated by each Lambda function.
- **Invocation Count**: Display the total number of invocations for each function.
- **Duration**: Monitor the average execution time for each Lambda function.

### 3. S3 Buckets
- **Number of Objects**: Show the total number of objects in specified S3 buckets.
- **Bucket Size**: Display the total size of data stored in the S3 buckets.
- **Request Metrics**: Monitor the total number of requests made to the S3 buckets.


## CloudWatch Alarms

### 1. High CPU Usage Alarm for EC2 Instances
- **Metric**: CPU Utilization
- **Threshold**: Trigger when CPU utilization exceeds 80% for 5 consecutive minutes.
- **Actions**: Send a notification to SNS.

### 2. Lambda Function Errors Alarm
- **Metric**: Errors
- **Threshold**: Trigger when the number of errors exceeds 1 in a 1-minute period.
- **Actions**: Send a notification to SNS.

## Setting Up Notifications Using AWS SNS

### 1. Create an SNS Topic
- Go to the SNS console and create a new topic (e.g., `MonitoringAlarms`).
- Set the topic type (Standard or FIFO based on requirements).
- Add subscriptions to the topic, such as email addresses, SMS numbers, or Lambda functions for processing.

### 2. Link Alarms to SNS Topic
- For each alarm (High CPU Usage and Lambda Function Errors), edit the alarm configuration:
  - In the **Actions** section, select "Send a notification to" and choose the SNS topic created earlier.
- Configure additional settings such as alarm state notifications (OK, ALARM, INSUFFICIENT_DATA).

### 3. Test Notifications
- Trigger the alarms (for example, by simulating high CPU usage) to ensure that notifications are sent successfully to all subscribed endpoints.

## Summary
This CloudWatch dashboard design allows comprehensive monitoring of EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and S3 buckets. By setting up specific alarms for critical metrics and linking them to an SNS topic, you can ensure timely alerts and proactive management of resources in the cloud environment.
