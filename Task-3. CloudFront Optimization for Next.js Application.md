# CloudFront Optimization for Next.js Application (Practical implementation)


![CloudFront Optimization for Next js Application](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ba47260-048f-4abf-8545-7c993220a25e)

#### Frontend is a Next.js application hosted on AWS Lambda using SST, with CloudFront as the CDN

## a) High Availability

#### Multi-Origin Setup with Lambda, S3 with Regional Distribution and Failover Testing to utilize Failover criteria for more structured failure scenario

### Strategy for High Availability:
- **Multi-Origin Setup:** Configure CloudFront to pull content from multiple origins (e.g., AWS S3, API Gateway, Lambda). This ensures redundancy, allowing CloudFront to serve content from alternative origins if one fails.
- **Regional Distribution:** Deploy the Next.js application across multiple AWS regions. CloudFront can route requests to the nearest healthy origin based on latency and availability.

### Failover Testing:


- **Simulate Failures:** Manually disable one origin to monitor CloudFrontâ€™s ability to reroute requests effectively. Utilize AWS Fault Injection Simulator for more structured failure scenarios.
- **Monitor Health Checks:** Set up health checks in CloudFront to continuously monitor the status of origins and ensure automatic rerouting in case of failures.

## b) Bot Attack Mitigation

#### AWS WAF Integration, AWS Managed Rules for Bot Control
  
### Methods to Minimize Bot Attacks:
- **AWS WAF Integration:** Leverage AWS WAF to filter out malicious traffic using predefined rules that identify suspicious patterns and behaviors.
- **Bot Control Features:** Enable AWS Managed Rules for Bot Control to automatically block or rate-limit known bad bots.

### Rate Limiting Implementation:
- **Setup:** Configure WAF rules to limit requests from a single IP to a specified threshold (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
- **Benefits:** This approach helps prevent DDoS attacks, minimizes abuse of resources, and ensures fair usage among legitimate users.

## c) SEO Crawler Allowance

### Allowing Legitimate SEO Crawlers:
- **User-Agent Filtering:** Create WAF rules that allow requests from known SEO crawler User-Agent strings (e.g., Googlebot).
- **IP Whitelisting:** Maintain a list of legitimate SEO crawler IP addresses to allow through the WAF while blocking suspicious ones.

### Implementation:
- Use a combination of User-Agent checks and IP filtering to differentiate between good bots (SEO) and malicious bots.

## d) Monitoring

![monitoring and logs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b51eadd1-39f4-4254-aef9-ac45b38c0c88)

#### Monitor RPS, cache hit ratio, and error rates, using CloudFront logs and AWS CloudWatch for insights and alerts.

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- **Requests per Second (RPS):** Understand traffic patterns and load.
- **Cache Hit Ratio:** Measure how effectively content is being cached.
- **Error Rates:** Track 4xx and 5xx error rates to identify issues.

### Logging and Analysis:
- **CloudFront Logs:** Enable access logs to capture detailed request information.
- **AWS CloudWatch:** Set up dashboards to visualize key metrics and configure alarms for unusual patterns (e.g., spikes in error rates).

## e) Site Loading Time Optimization

![Site Loading Time Optimization](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a12e351-e7ce-487c-9f60-c47e6a5bfd1d)

Reduce site loading time with CloudFront caching, Lambda@Edge, and Gzip compression, while measuring impact using Google PageSpeed Insights and monitoring metrics in CloudWatch.

### Methods to Reduce Site Loading Time:
- **Content Caching:** Configure CloudFront to cache static assets (e.g., images, stylesheets) and serve them directly from edge locations.
- **Use of Lambda@Edge:** Implement Lambda@Edge to customize content delivery based on user location and device type.
- **Gzip Compression:** Enable Gzip compression on CloudFront to reduce the size of transmitted files.

### Measuring Impact:
- **Performance Monitoring Tools:** Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and WebPageTest to analyze loading times before and after optimizations.
- **CloudFront Metrics:** Monitor improvements in the cache hit ratio and reduced latency in CloudWatch.
